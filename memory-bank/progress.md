# Project Progress: Divergent Nodes

## Overall Status
- Initial project setup and Memory Bank initialization.
- Implementation phase for UTF-8 encoding for Gemini Node prompts completed.

## Completed Milestones/Features
- **Memory Bank Setup (Initial):**
    - `projectbrief.md` created.
    - `activeContext.md` created.
    - `progress.md` created.
- **Feature: UTF-8 Encoding for Gemini Prompts**
    - **Status:** Completed
    - **Details:** Defined a new utility function for UTF-8 conversion and integrated it into `gemini_api_node.py` for both input prompts and output text.
- **Feature: SaveImageEnhancedNode**
    - **Status:** Completed
    - **Details:** Created a new node `SaveImageEnhancedNode` in `source/image_utils/save_image_enhanced_node.py` to replace `SaveImageKJ`. Implemented UTF-8 encoding for captions and added an optional filename counter suffix. Corrected node registration by moving mappings to `source/image_utils/__init__.py` and updating `source/__init__.py` accordingly. Updated the node's `CATEGORY` string to include the alien emoji for consistent grouping. Added `.gitignore`.

## Known Issues/Bugs
- (None identified yet)

## Decision Log & Evolution
- **[YYYY-MM-DD]:** Decided to place the UTF-8 utility in a new shared module `text_encoding_utils.py`.
- **[YYYY-MM-DD]:** Established initial Memory Bank files as per protocol.
- **[YYYY-MM-DD]:** Decided to create a new node `SaveImageEnhancedNode` within the project instead of modifying `ComfyUI-KJNodes`.
- **[YYYY-MM-DD]:** Corrected node registration strategy by using `__init__.py` files within sub-packages for mappings.
- **[YYYY-MM-DD]:** Ensured consistency in node category string format, including the alien emoji.
