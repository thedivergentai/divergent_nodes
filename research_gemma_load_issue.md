# Gemma Multimodal Node - Code Review and Fix Plan

## Code Review Findings:

- **CLIP Integration**: The current implementation extracts image features using CLIP and converts them into a comma-separated string to be included in the prompt. This approach is likely inefficient and not the intended way to handle multimodal input for Gemma.
- **Prompt Construction**: The prompt format includes `<image>`, `<bos>`, `<start_of_turn>`, `<end_of_turn>`, and `<model>`. It's important to verify if this format is correct and optimal for Gemma multimodal models with `llama-cpp-python`.
- **Model Loading and Caching**: The model loading and caching are basic. It only checks for URL changes. More robust caching might be needed.
- **GPU Layers**: `n_gpu_layers` is hardcoded. Should be configurable.
- **MMProj Loading**: Loaded on CPU, might need to be on GPU if available.
- **Error Handling**: Basic error handling, could be improved.

## Fix Plan:

1. **Investigate CLIP Feature Handling**:
    - Research if `llama-cpp-python` or Gemma model has specific methods for handling image features.
    - Look for examples or documentation on how to properly pass image embeddings to Gemma using `llama-cpp-python`.
    - Explore if there's a way to pass the `image_features` tensor directly instead of converting it to a string.

2. **Refactor CLIP Integration**:
    - Based on the investigation, refactor the `process` function to correctly integrate CLIP image features with Gemma.
    - Remove the inefficient string conversion of `image_features`.
    - Implement the recommended approach for passing image embeddings.

3. **Review Prompt Format**:
    - Verify the prompt format used in the `process` function against Gemma's documentation or examples.
    - Adjust the prompt format if necessary to ensure compatibility and optimal performance.

4. **Implement Code Changes**:
    - Modify the `process` function in `source/gemma_multimodal_node.py` to incorporate the refactored CLIP integration and prompt format.
    - Ensure the code is clean, efficient, and follows coding best practices.

5. **Testing**:
    - After implementing the changes, test the `GemmaMultimodal` node with different images and prompts to verify the fix.
    - Compare the results with expected behavior or examples if available.

6. **Consolidate and Apply Changes**:
    - Consolidate all code changes into a single update.
    - Use `write_to_file` tool to update `source/gemma_multimodal_node.py` with the corrected code.

## Next Steps:

- Start investigating CLIP feature handling and prompt format for Gemma multimodal models with `llama-cpp-python`.
- Document findings and update the fix plan as needed.
- Proceed to ACT mode once the investigation and plan are finalized.
