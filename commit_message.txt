Fix: Definitive resolution of TypeError in gemini_utils.py and other critical issues (Requires ComfyUI Restart)

This commit definitively resolves the persistent `TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not iterable` in `source/google_ai/gemini_utils.py` by implementing comprehensive and robust handling for `safety_ratings` and `prompt_feedback` in API responses. This addresses the intermittent nature of the error by ensuring all possible response structures are gracefully handled.

Additionally, this commit includes the resolution of other critical issues identified during the previous debugging sessions:
- **`TypeError: 'GenerateContentConfig' object does not support item assignment` in `source/google_ai/gemini_api_node.py`:** Fixed by correctly passing `thinking_config` during `GenerateContentConfig` instantiation.
- **`OSError: [Errno 22] Invalid argument` in `source/image_utils/save_image_enhanced_node.py`:** Fixed by implementing comprehensive filename sanitization.

**IMPORTANT: For these changes to take full effect, please completely restart your ComfyUI server (close the command-line window and start it again).** This will ensure the updated code is loaded from disk and any cached versions are cleared.

The `memory-bank/activeContext.md` and `memory-bank/progress.md` files have been updated to reflect these resolved issues and the current project status.
