Fix: Resolve TypeError in gemini_utils.py and other critical issues

This commit addresses and definitively resolves the persistent `TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not iterable` in `source/google_ai/gemini_utils.py` by implementing robust handling for `safety_ratings` to ensure it is always an iterable.

Additionally, this commit includes the resolution of other critical issues identified during the previous debugging sessions:
- **`TypeError: 'GenerateContentConfig' object does not support item assignment` in `source/google_ai/gemini_api_node.py`:** Fixed by correctly passing `thinking_config` during `GenerateContentConfig` instantiation.
- **`OSError: [Errno 22] Invalid argument` in `source/image_utils/save_image_enhanced_node.py`:** Fixed by implementing comprehensive filename sanitization.

The `memory-bank/activeContext.md` and `memory-bank/progress.md` files have been updated to reflect these resolved issues and the current project status.
